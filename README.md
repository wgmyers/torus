# Torus

Or donut.

## Well, make your mind up.

I don't know. They're both such good words.

## What is this, anyway?

I'm having a play with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## Why?

Why not?

## Can I see it?

[Here](http://www.conniptions.org/torus/) you go.

## Oh.

Yes. Next stop, replace the torus with a chocolate teapot.

## I don't think p5.js has a primitive for that.

No, it doesn't.
